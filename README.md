# node-stash

`node-stash` is a node project that acts like a file uploading service, just that it is protected with a simple password and allows the user to upload password encrypted files.

## Get started

1. First, clone the repository to any folder you want.
2. Open the file `src/config.js` and edit all values to your own preferences.
3. Go back to the root directory of the cloned repository and run `npm start`, this should start the http server under the given port.

**Please be aware that the project does not support HTTPS by itself, so I recommend using nginx which handles all requests.**

If you really need HTTPS support, don't be afraid of telling me or if not even make a pull request.
